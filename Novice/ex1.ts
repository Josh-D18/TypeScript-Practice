// Create a Typescript function that takes in two numbers and returns their sum. This exercise will help you understand how to declare and use functions in Typescript.

const twoSum = (num: number, num2: number): number => {
  return num + num2;
};

console.log(twoSum(2, 7));
console.log(twoSum(9, 11));
